<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>When I moved to Georgia in 2010, I was reading on a first-grade level, so my mom decided to keep me in the fifth grade one more year. Before the first quarter ended, my mother and the teachers noticed that I was excelling in Math and Science. During this time, I was diagnosed with dyslexia. When I started to attend KIPP Strive Academy, knew that was the school that would help my dyslexia. At KIPP Strive, they knew of my problem, so instead of having different electives like the other student, I attended a class to help me learn the basics that I missed in elementary school. The staff at KIPP Strive empowered me to overcome my challenge with dyslexia by reading loads of books each week and breaking down each word. When I began high school, I continued to work on my reading levels. By the end of tenth grade, my reading was evaluated and the data showed that I was reading on the college level. Like KIPP’s motto, “There are no Shortcuts,” it took a lot of work to get above my reading level and there was no way I could do it without practicing all the time.Now I'm attending DePauw University and I'm in a CSSI with Google.</p>
